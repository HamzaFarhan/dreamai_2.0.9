When $u = v = w = \frac{1}{3}$, then $\text{min}(u, v, w) = \frac{1}{3}$. Thus, $u + \frac{1}{3}\times \text{min}(u, v, w) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}\times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{4}{9}$. Therefore, the maximum value of $u + \frac{1}{3}\times \text{min}(u, v, w)$ is $\frac{4}{9}$.",
