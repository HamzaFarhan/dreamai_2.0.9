    "problem": "Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be nonnegative real numbers such that $a + b + c = 1.$  Find the maximum value of\n\\[a + \\sqrt{ab} + \\sqrt[3]{abc}.\\]",
    "solution": "Our strategy is to add a number of inequalities like\n\\[a + b \\ge 2 \\sqrt{ab},\\]so that when we add them up, we get an inequality of the form\n\\[t(a + b + c) \\ge a + \\sqrt{ab} + \\sqrt[3]{abc}.\\]To do so, we will use some variables, to make sure we use the most general forms of AM-GM.\n\nIf we apply AM-GM to two terms, one of which is $pb,$ then to obtain $\\sqrt{ab}$ on the right-hand side, the other term must be $\\frac{1}{4p} a,$ as in\n\\[\\frac{1}{4p} a + pb \\ge 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4p} a \\cdot pb} = \\sqrt{ab}. \\quad (*)\\]Note that equality holds when $\\frac{1}{4p} a = pb,$ or $\\frac{a}{b} = 4p^2.$  Thus,\n\nWe then want an inequality of the form\n\\[xa + yb + zc \\ge \\sqrt[3]{abc},\\]where $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are coefficients that we want to fill in.  We want equality to hold here for the same values of $a$ and $b$ as in $(*)$.  This means we want $xa = yb,$ or $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{4p^2}.$  So, let $x = \\frac{1}{4pk}$ and $y = \\frac{p}{k}$:\n\\[\\frac{1}{4pk} a + \\frac{p}{k} b + zc \\ge \\sqrt[3]{abc}.\\]Finally, $z$ should be $\\frac{4k^2}{27},$ so that we obtain $\\sqrt[3]{abc}$ on the right-hand side:\n\\[\\frac{1}{4pk} a + \\frac{p}{k} b + \\frac{4k^2}{27} c \\ge 3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{4pk} a \\cdot \\frac{p}{k} b \\cdot \\frac{4k^2}{27} c} = \\sqrt[3]{abc}. \\quad (**)\\]Thus, we have the inequalities\n\\begin{align*}\na &\\ge a, \\\\\n\\frac{1}{4p} a + pb &\\ge \\sqrt{ab}, \\\\\n\\frac{1}{4pk} a + \\frac{p}{k} b + \\frac{4k^2}{27} c &\\ge \\sqrt[3]{abc}.\n\\end{align*}When we add these up, we want the coefficients of $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ to be equal.  Thus,\n\\[1 + \\frac{1}{4p} + \\frac{1}{4pk} = p + \\frac{p}{k} = \\frac{4k^2}{27}.\\]Isolating $p$ in $p + \\frac{p}{k} = \\frac{4k^2}{27},$ we find\n\\[p = \\frac{4k^3}{27(k + 1)}.\\]Then\n\\[1 + \\frac{1}{4p} + \\frac{1}{4pk} = \\frac{4pk + k + 1}{4pk} = \\frac{4k^2}{27}.\\]Cross-multiplying, we get\n\\[27(4pk + k + 1) = 16pk^3.\\]Substituting $p = \\frac{4k^3}{27(k + 1)},$ we get\n\\[27 \\left( 4k \\cdot \\frac{4k^3}{27(k + 1)} + k + 1 \\right) = 16k^3 \\cdot \\frac{4k^3}{27(k + 1)}.\\]Then\n\\[27(16k^4 + 27(k + 1)^2) = 64k^3.\\]This simplifies to $64k^6 - 432k^4 - 729k^2 - 1458k - 729 = 0.$  Fortunately, this polynomial has $k = 3$ as a root.\n\nThen $p = 1,$ and we get\n\\[\\frac{4}{3} a + \\frac{4}{3} b + \\frac{4}{3} c \\ge a + \\sqrt{ab} + \\sqrt[3]{abc}.\\]Therefore,\n\\[a + \\sqrt{ab} + \\sqrt[3]{abc} \\le \\frac{4}{3}.\\]Equality occurs when $a = \\frac{16}{21},$ $b = \\frac{4}{21},$ and $c = \\frac{1}{21},$ so the maximum value is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}.$",
