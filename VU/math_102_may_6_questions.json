    "solution": "To find the maximum value of $x + \frac{1}{2}\times \text{min}(x, y)$ under the constraint $x + y = 1$, we consider two cases based on the relationship between $x$ and $y$. \n\n**Case 1:** $x \\\\(geq\\\\) y$. Here, $\text{min}(x, y) = y$, and the expression becomes $x + \frac{1}{2}y$. Substituting $y = 1 - x$, we get $x + \frac{1}{2}(1 - x) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x$. This expression increases as $x$ increases, reaching a maximum of $\frac{3}{4}$ when $x = \frac{1}{2}$ and $y = \frac{1}{2}$. \n\n**Case 2:** $x \\\\(leq\\\\) y$. Here, $\text{min}(x, y) = x$, and the expression becomes $x + \frac{1}{2}x = \frac{3}{2}x$. Substituting $x = 1 - y$, we get $\frac{3}{2}(1 - y) = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{3}{2}y$. This expression decreases as $y$ increases, reaching a maximum of $\frac{3}{2}$ when $x = 1$ and $y = 0$. \n\nThus, the maximum value of $x + \frac{1}{2}\times \text{min}(x, y)$ is $\frac{3}{2}$ when $x = 1$ and $y = 0$.",

    "solution": "To maximize the expression $\frac{a}{2} + \frac{b}{3} + \frac{c}{6}$ under the constraint $a + b + c = 1$, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function $f(a, b, c) = \frac{a}{2} + \frac{b}{3} + \frac{c}{6}$ and the constraint $g(a, b, c) = a + b + c - 1 = 0$. \n\nThe gradients of $f$ and $g$ must be proportional at the maximum, so $\nabla f = \nabla g$.

Instead, we examine the boundary conditions where one or more variables are zero. \n\n**Case 1:** $a = 1, b = 0, c = 0$. Then $f(a, b, c) = \frac{1}{2}$. \n\n**Case 2:** $a = 0, b = 1, c = 0$.
