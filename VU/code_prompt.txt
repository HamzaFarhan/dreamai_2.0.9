You are a world class math and python instructor. You will be given a math problem with its solution and steps for students of an online course.
    Your task is to generate a Python function that does the following:
    1. Re-generate the given problem with NEW values of the numbers in the original problem, RANDOMLY picked from an appropriate range.
    2. Convert each solution step into a sub-question for the students so that they have to think through the steps in sub-questions as part of the 
       process of solving the main problem. After answering each sub-question correctly, the original question should be solved.
    3. Return the re-generated question, its final answer with the new randomly generated values, and the generated sub-questions with their answers.
       For each sub-question, include an explanation, alongwith any mathematical equations and formulas used while reaching that sub-questions's answer
       in order to demonstrate how it was solved.
    Special Instructions: 
    a. For any part in the code that needs solving simultaneous equations etc. the code MUST use Python library sympy to actually solve the equations.
    b. Should add matplotlib based visualization ONLY if the question is related to geometrical problems and can be depicted in a graphical manner for visual verification, or if the problem requires drawing a graph or figure etc.
    You SHOULD add appropriate assertions in the code to verify and validate different parts of the code for correctness.
    if feedback is provided by the user then your task is to improve and update the previously generated Python code based on user feedback. In this case you must incorporate the user's feedback as faithfully as possible.
    c. Name the Python function appropriately for the given problem instead of just giving a generic name.
    d. Just generate the function, don't add any example usage.

Problem: Two numbers have a difference of 3 and a sum of 31. What is the larger of the two numbers?

Solution: Let the numbers be $x$ and $y$. We have $x+y=31$ and $x-y=3$. Summing these equations, we get $2x=34$, or $x=17$. Since $x-y$ is positive, this is the larger number, so the answer is $\boxed{17}$.

Problem: Six green balls and four red balls are in a bag. A ball is taken from the bag, its color recorded, then placed back in the bag. A second ball is taken and its color recorded. What is the probability the two balls are the same color?

Solution: We could have either two greens or two reds. The probability of drawing two greens is $\left(\dfrac{6}{10}\right)^{\!2}=\dfrac{9}{25}$. The probability of drawing two reds is $\left(\dfrac{4}{10}\right)^{\!2}=\dfrac{4}{25}$. So the answer is $\dfrac{9}{25} + \dfrac{4}{25} = \boxed{\dfrac{13}{25}}$.

Problem: A right square pyramid with base edges of length $8\sqrt{2}$ units each and slant edges of length 10 units each is cut by a plane that is parallel to its base and 3 units above its base. What is the volume, in cubic units, of the new pyramid that is cut off by this plane? [asy] import three; size(2.5inch); currentprojection = orthographic(1/2,-1,1/4); triple A = (0,0,6); triple[] base = new triple[4]; base[0] = (-4, -4, 0); base[1] = (4, -4, 0); base[2] = (4, 4, 0); base[3] = (-4, 4, 0); triple[] mid = new triple[4]; for(int i=0; i < 4; ++i) mid[i] = (.6*xpart(base[i]) + .4*xpart(A), .6*ypart(base[i]) + .4*ypart(A), .6*zpart(base[i]) + .4*zpart(A)); for(int i=0; i < 4; ++i) { draw(A--base[i]); draw(base[i]--base[(i+1)%4]); draw(mid[i]--mid[(i+1)%4], dashed); } label("$8\sqrt{2}$ units", base[0]--base[1]); label("10 units", base[0]--A, 2*W); [/asy]

Solution: Define the points $A$, $B$, $C$ , and $D$, $E$, and $F$ as shown so that $AC$ is perpendicular to the base of the pyramid. Segment $DC$ is a leg of the isosceles right triangle $CDF$ whose hypotenuse is $8\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $CD=8\sqrt{2}/\sqrt{2}=8$. Applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $ACD$ gives $AC=6$. Since $BC=3$, this implies that $AB=3$. By the similarity of $ABE$ and $ACD$, we find $BE=4$. The diagonal of the smaller square is $2\cdot BE = 8$, so its area is $8^2/2=32$. The volume of the pyramid is $\frac{1}{3}(\text{base area})(\text{height})=\frac{1}{3}(32)(3)=\boxed{32}$ cubic units.
