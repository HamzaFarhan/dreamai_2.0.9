\[(2x + x^2)(2x^2 + x^4)(2x^3 + x^6)(2x^4 + x^8)(2x^5 + x^{10})(2x^6 + x^{12}).\]","Note that $x^7 = \cos 2 \pi + i \sin 2 \pi = 1,$ so $x^7 - 1 = 0,$ which factors as
\[(x - 1)(x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = 0.\]Since $x \neq 1,$
\[x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0.\]Then
\begin{align*}
(2x + x^2)(2x^6 + x^{12}) &= 4x^7 + 2x^8 + 2x^{13} + x^{14} = 4 + 2x + 2x^6 + 1 = 5 + 2x + 2x^6, \\
(2x^2 + x^4)(2x^5 + x^{10}) &= 4x^7 + 2x^9 + 2x^{12} + x^{14} = 4 + 2x^2 + 2x^5 + 1 = 5 + 2x^2 + 2x^5, \\
(2x^3 + x^6)(2x^4 + x^8) &= 4x^7 + 2x^{10} + 2x^{11} + x^{14} = 4 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + 1 = 5 + 2x^3 + 2x^4.
\end{align*}Let $\alpha = x + x^6,$ $\beta = x^2 + x^5,$ and $\gamma = x^3 + x^4,$ so we want to compute
\[(5 + 2 \alpha)(5 + 2 \beta)(5 + 2 \gamma).\]Then
\[\alpha + \beta + \gamma = x + x^6 + x^2 + x^5 + x^3 + x^4 = -1.\]Also,
\begin{align*}
\alpha \beta + \alpha \gamma + \beta \gamma &= (x + x^6)(x^2 + x^5) + (x + x^6)(x^3 + x^4) + (x^2 + x^5)(x^3 + x^4) \\
&= x^3 + x^6 + x^8 + x^{11} + x^4 + x^5 + x^9 + x^{10} + x^5 + x^6 + x^8 + x^9 \\
&= x^3 + x^6 + x + x^4 + x^4 + x^5 + x^2 + x^3 + x^5 + x^6 + x + x^2 \\
&= 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + 2x^5 + 2x^6 \\
&= -2
\end{align*}and
\begin{align*}
\alpha \beta \gamma &= (x + x^6)(x^2 + x^5)(x^3 + x^4) \\
&= (x^3 + x^6 + x^8 + x^{11})(x^3 + x^4) \\
&= (x^3 + x^6 + x + x^4)(x^3 + x^4) \\
&= x^6 + x^9 + x^4 + x^7 + x^7 + x^{10} + x^5 + x^8 \\
&= x^6 + x^2 + x^4 + 1 + 1 + x^3 + x^5 + x \\
&= 1.
\end{align*}Therefore,
\begin{align*}
(5 + 2 \alpha)(5 + 2 \beta)(5 + 2 \gamma) &= 125 + 50 (\alpha + \beta + \gamma) + 20 (\alpha \beta + \alpha \gamma + \beta \gamma) + 8 \alpha \beta \gamma \\
&= 125 + 50(-1) + 20(-2) + 8(1) \\
&= \boxed{43}.

size(4cm);
real x=sqrt(3);
pair d=(2,0); pair c=(1,x); pair b=(-1,x); pair a=-d; pair f=-c; pair e=-b;
pair g=(a+b)/2; pair h=(c+d)/2; pair i=(e+f)/2;

label(""$F$"",f,SSW);
label(""$G$"",g,WNW);
label(""$H$"",h,ENE);
label(""$I$"",i,S);
[/asy]

To increase the symmetry in the diagram, we can draw in the long diagonals of $ABCDEF$ as well as the mirror image of $\triangle GHI$ across these diagonals:

[asy]
size(4cm);
real x=sqrt(3);
pair d=(2,0); pair c=(1,x); pair b=(-1,x); pair a=-d; pair f=-c; pair e=-b;

These additional lines divide $ABCDEF$ into $24$ congruent equilateral triangles, of which $\triangle GHI$ covers exactly $9$. Thus each of the triangles has area $\frac{225}{9}=25$, and hexagon $ABCDEF$ has area $24\cdot 25=\boxed{600}$.",easy

Quadratic Equations,Quadratic Formula,Find Discriminant,"A real number $a$ is chosen randomly and uniformly from the interval $[-20, 18]$. Find the probability that the roots of the polynomial
\[x^4 + 2ax^3 + (2a - 2)x^2 + (-4a + 3)x - 2\]are all real.","Let $p(x)$ be the given polynomial. Notice that \[p(1) = 1 + (2a) + (2a-2) - (4a+3) - 2 = 0,\]so $1$ is a root of $p(x).$ Performing polynomial division, we then have \[p(x) = (x-1)(x^3+(2a+1)x^2+(4a-1)x+2).\]Notice that \[p(-2) = 1 \cdot (-8 + 4(2a+1) - 2(4a-1) + 2) = 0,\]so $-2$ is a root of $p(x)$ as well. Dividing the cubic term by $x+2,$ we then have \[p(x) = (x-1)(x+2)(x^2+(2a-1)x+1).\]Therefore, we want to find the probability that the roots of $x^2 + (2a-1)x + 1$ are all real. This occurs if and only if the discriminant is nonnegative: \[(2a-1)^2 - 4 \ge 0,\]or $(2a-1)^2 \ge 4.$ Thus, either $2a-1 \ge 2$ or $2a-1 \le -2.$ The first inequality is equivalent to $a \ge \tfrac{3}{2},$ and the second is equivalent to $a \le -\tfrac{1}{2}.$ This shows that all values of $a$ except those in the interval $\left(-\tfrac12, \tfrac32\right)$ satisfy the condition. This interval has length $2,$ and the given interval $[-20, 18],$ which contains it completely, has length $18 - (-20) = 38,$ so the probability is \[1 - \frac{2}{38} = \boxed{\frac{18}{19}}.\]",easy

Coordinate Geometry Basics,Distance Between Two Points,Calculate Distance Formula,A regular hexagon is inscribed in a circle and another regular hexagon is circumscribed about the same circle. What is the ratio of the area of the larger hexagon to the area of the smaller hexagon? Express your answer as a common fraction.,"Form a triangle whose first vertex is the center of the circle and whose other two vertices are the midpoint and one of the endpoints of a side of the larger hexagon, as shown in the diagram.  Since each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees, this triangle is a 30-60-90 right triangle.  Let $r$ be the radius of the circle.  The length of the longer leg of the triangle is $r$, so the length of the shorter leg is $r/\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $2r/\sqrt{3}$.  Since for the smaller hexagon the length of the segment connecting a vertex to the center is $r$, the dimensions of the larger hexagon are $2/\sqrt{3}$ times larger than the dimensions of the smaller hexagon.  Therefore, the area of the larger triangle is $(2/\sqrt{3})^2=\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}$ times greater than the area of the smaller triangle.

\[\cos 4x + \cos^2 3x + \cos^3 2x + \cos^4 x = 0\]for $-\pi \le x \le \pi.$","We can express all the terms in terms of $\cos 2x$:
\begin{align*}
\cos 4x &= 2 \cos^2 2x - 1, \\
\cos^2 3x &= \frac{\cos 6x + 1}{2} = \frac{4 \cos^3 2x - 3 \cos 2x + 1}{2}, \\
\cos^3 2x &= \cos^3 2x, \\
\cos^4 x &= (\cos^2 x)^2 = \left( \frac{\cos 2x + 1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{\cos^2 2x + 2 \cos 2x + 1}{4}.
\end{align*}Thus,
\[2 \cos^2 2x - 1 + \frac{4 \cos^3 2x - 3 \cos 2x + 1}{2} + \cos^3 2x + \frac{\cos^2 2x + 2 \cos 2x + 1}{4} = 0.\]This simplifies to
\[12 \cos^3 2x + 9 \cos^2 2x - 4 \cos 2x - 1 = 0.\]We can factor this as
\[(\cos 2x + 1)(12 \cos^2 2x - 3 \cos 2x - 1) = 0.\]If $\cos 2x + 1 = 0,$ then $\cos 2x = -1.$  There are 2 solutions, namely $\pm \frac{\pi}{2}.$  Otherwise,
\[12 \cos^2 2x - 3 \cos 2x - 1 = 0.\]By the quadratic formula,
\[\cos 2x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{57}}{12}.\]Both values lie between $-1$ and $1,$ so for each value, there are 4 solutions.  This gives us a total of $2 + 4 + 4 = \boxed{10}$ solutions.",easy
