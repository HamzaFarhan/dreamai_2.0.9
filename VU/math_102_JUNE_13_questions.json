          "solution": "We can express all the terms in terms of cos 2x: cos 4x equals 2 cos squared 2x minus 1, cos squared 3x equals cos 6x plus 1 over 2 equals 4 cos cubed 2x minus 3 cos 2x plus 1 over 2, cos cubed 2x equals cos cubed 2x, cos to the 4th x equals cos squared x squared equals cos 2x plus 1 over 2 squared equals cos squared 2x plus 2 cos 2x plus 1 over 4. Thus, 2 cos squared 2x minus 1 plus 4 cos cubed 2x minus 3 cos 2x plus 1 over 2 plus cos cubed 2x plus cos squared 2x plus 2 cos 2x plus 1 over 4 equals 0. This simplifies to 12 cos cubed 2x plus 9 cos squared 2x minus 4 cos 2x minus 1 equals 0. We can factor this as cos 2x plus 1 times 12 cos squared 2x minus 3 cos 2x minus 1 equals 0. If cos 2x plus 1 equals 0, then cos 2x equals negative 1. There are 2 solutions, namely negative pi over 2 and pi over 2. Otherwise, 12 cos squared 2x minus 3 cos 2x minus 1 equals 0. By the quadratic formula, cos 2x equals 3 plus or minus square root of 57 over 12. Both values lie between negative 1 and 1, so for each value, there are 4 solutions.
